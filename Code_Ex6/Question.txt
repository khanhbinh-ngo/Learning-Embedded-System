== KIEM TRA CAM BIEN AM THANH ==

== SCENARIO ==
a. devices
+ 1 sound sensor
+ 10 led 
+ follower devices
b. main idea:
+ when create a random sound, sensor will take this and convert to LED signals
+ more strong the sound, more HIGH leds were turn on


== IDEATE == 

step[1]:
    + receive data from the sensor
step[2]: 
    + create some conventions of range of sound
    + 10 levels from lowest to highest
    + 4 first levels, each levels have 20points 
    + from 5th level to 10th, each level gain more 20 points than previous level
step[3]: 
    + depend on how high the signal, turn on LEDs as more as we have setup before
step[4]: 
    + I realized that I can act like an anime character, so I decided to add sinwave and calculate those signals
    + by using one function to act like a god
