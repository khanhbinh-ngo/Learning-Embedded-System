== SCENARIO ==
a. devices
+ 1 sound sensor
+ 10 led 
+ follower devices
b. main idea:
+ when create a random sound, sensor will take this and convert to LED signals
+ more strong the sound, more HIGH leds were turn on


== IDEAS == 

step[1]:
    + receive data from the sensor

step[2]: 
    + create some conventions of range of sound
    + 10 levels from lowest to highest
    + 4 first levels, each levels have 20points 
    + from 5th level to 10th, each level gain more 20 points than previous level
    
step[3]: 
    + depend on how high the signal, turn on LEDs as more as we have setup before
